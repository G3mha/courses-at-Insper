# ROS-knowledge
Based on the following course: https://www.udemy.com/share/101JOg3@dpMwv8Gqd1zjkWW0WckCAGEdm69lyw5tkJuyMyXRlIYCx_wymW1sx4KAWx9c72sA8Q==/

This repo was created during my holidays, from Insper, for the purpose of remembering some of the key features of ROS SLAM, since I'll be the student mentor in Computational Robotics (which deals with ROS and OpenCV).
